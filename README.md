# Cluster HAT
Scripts and files used to build Cluster HAT images from Raspbian/Ubuntu/Debian for OrangePi CM4.

**Why?**  
The Cluster CTRL page offers images for Raspberry Pi and are not usable for the Orange Pi CM4 board, also the original scripts to build these images are in https://github.com/burtyb/clusterhat-image, but they work only with Raspbian/RaspiOS for Raspberry images

## Cluster HAT Files for Orange Pi CM4
The images can be downloaded from the official page: http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/service-and-support/Orange-Pi-CM4-1.html

## Building Cluster HAT Images
The build script is located in the build directory.

When building arm64 images you need to be on an arm64 machine.


The files/ directory contains the files extracted into the root filesystem of a Cluster HAT image.
